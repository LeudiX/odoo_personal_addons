## For Odoo installation process

-Strongly recommended to install it directly in your local repo folder
in order to have direct admin access

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\

## For Odoo authentication process

-\> Once installed, follow the next steps:

1-Go to localhost:\[port\] to check the Odoo DB Manager loads smoothly

2-Create a new role user in pgadmin:odoo and assign it a password(odoo)

3-In privileges section of the odoo role, activate: can_login and
create_db toggle buttons or superuser

4-Deactivate Odoo and PostgreSQL services (net stop odoo-server-17.0)
and (net stop postgresql-x64-14) for windows. If you use Linux, find a
way XD 5-In Postgresql\\v\\data\\ folder configure postgres to trust all
the connections coming from localhost or other clients ip addresses In
pg_hba.conf: host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust 6-Ensure that in the file
postgresql.conf the variable listen_addresses is set to listen_addresses
= \'\*\' 7-Configure your odoo.conf file with your db_user \[odoo\] and
db_password \[odoo\] custom postgres odoo\'s user credentials values
-Optional:Change the port if you already have another version of Odoo
runinng at localhost \[8072\]

8-Activate PostgreSQL and Odoo services (Odoo depends on Postgres, so
you know the order i guess)

9-Go to localhost:8069 Odoo DB Manager and following this order to
register the user and DB:

-Master Password field: Autogenerated or you can override it by yourself
(Save it and dont forget it. You will need it for future messy actions
over Odoo) -DB Name: Enter the name of the DB you want to create
\[flights\]. Don\'t reference any created already PostgresDB -Password:
Enter your postgresql user password (not your Odoo password, the one you
put in odoo.conf file) -Phone N: Optional -Language: Choose your
favorite -Country: Choose your favorite -Demo data: If selected, Odoo
adds some initial sample data into your apps (Takes more time to
complete the registration process)

9-Confirm the creation of the DB (Hope for the best, prepare for the
worst XD)

10-If evertything goes fine, you will be redirected to:
localhost:8069/web/login

10-Authenticate in the odoo client: localhost:8069/web/login with the
credentials you provided before in the register form. Ex: \[email:
leudix pass:rosw3ll(postgresql user password)\]

11-Expect the magic to happens!!!!

12- Go inside yourself and start playing yourself with Odoo for a while

## App Installation in Odoo

-Once Odoo got installed go to your odoo.conf file and update the
admin_passwd field with your desired value
-Restart Odoo Service
-Then,when you want to add a new app, go to your odoo db manager, and in the
master password field put the admin_passwd you update before to create a
new DB for your module
-Authenticate in the system
-To add your created app into Odoo, enable developer mode, then go to Apps, Update Apps List,
update and let the magic happens
-Filter your app for the name and installed it
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\

## Dev Guidelines when working with python and XML files

-Restart the odoo service every time you make a change in python files
-Upgrade the module when working with XML views files (it will automatically refresh the view and load the changes)
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\

## Flake Rules Customization

-Remember flake rules are defined inside the setup.cfg file. So go
there if you want to add any customization
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\

## Connection to an existing Postgres DB connection

-In postgres, change the user to you odoo user

WARNING: Avoid to use the same DB between different Odoo versions (Corrupted)

## Persistent VENV references avoiding debug (ISSUE)

1.Delete the .vscode Folder:

2.Close VS Code.

3.Navigate to your project directory.

4.Delete the .vscode folder entirely. This will remove all VS Code settings and configurations for the project.

5.Check for Global VS Code Settings:

6.Open VS Code.

7.Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or press Ctrl+,).

8.Search for python.pythonPath or python.venvPath.

9.If you find any references to the old virtual environment (D:\\GitHub\\Odoo\\server\\odoo\\my_addons\\loan_service_management\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe), remove them.

10.Clear VS Code Cache:

11.Close VS Code.

12.Delete the following folders to clear VS Code's cache:

    Windows: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Code
